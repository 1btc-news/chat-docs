# Connect Wallet

Connect with either a [Hiro](https://wallet.hiro.so/wallet/install-web) or [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/) wallet, both renowned leaders in Bitcoin standards on the web.

The wallet is used to to generate the required signatures and determine the dust address for verification. It is also used to log into the chat application once verification is complete.

Once connected, the logged in account will be registered with the 1btc API in the background to start the verification process. If you've already started the process, it will pick up right where you left off.

The wallet can also be used to access other Bitcoin applications, hold inscriptions, register names, and more!
