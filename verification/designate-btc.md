# Designate BTC

In most Bitcoin wallet software, a set of addresses are represented as an "account", and commonly the balance we see comes from several different addresses within that account.

This step creates a separate account for the balance used to verify, which helps:

* consolidate the required Bitcoin balance into one location for verification
* provide an easy way to label the funds so they aren't accidentally spent
* allow users to hold the balance in the wallet of their choice
