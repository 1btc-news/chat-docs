# Insufficient Origin

Uh-oh! Looks like the address used to send the dust transaction no longer holds more than 1 BTC.

In order to access 1btc Chat again, you'll need to either:

* top up the address with the correct amount of funds OR
* verify again [from step 1](connect-wallet.md) using a new Hiro / Xverse account

{% hint style="warning" %}
The verification website will display the address known to the API. It is your responsibility to verify this address in your wallet software and transaction history.
{% endhint %}
